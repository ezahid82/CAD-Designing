### Reflection
This assignment was a bit hard because The rectangle wouldn't look like intended by the embeded video in the tutorial document. I tried editing and adding the values to the sketch many times, but it still wouldn't work. So, I deleted the hole sketch and retried the steps which helped fix the problem. I wouldn't spend too much time fixing a problem if I can delete it and re-do it *correctly*
