### Reflection

This assignment was a bit hard because The rectangle wouldn't look like intended by the embeded video in the tutorial document. I tried editing and adding the values to the sketch many times, but it still wouldn't work. So, I deleted the hole sketch and retried the steps which helped fix the problem. I wouldn't spend too much time fixing a problem if I can delete it and re-do it *correctly*

## Reflection

This assignment was a Bit difficult because I didn't know if the Truck Hanger was at the right spot even after following the instructions. Even after creating it, I had to add the ledge that holds the Hanger in place which I missed in the instructions with the bushing. I added the ledge after completing the whole truck.
