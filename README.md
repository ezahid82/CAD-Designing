### Reflection

This assignment was a bit hard because The rectangle wouldn't look like intended by the embeded video in the tutorial document. I tried editing and adding the values to the sketch many times, but it still wouldn't work. So, I deleted the hole sketch and retried the steps which helped fix the problem. I wouldn't spend too much time fixing a problem if I can delete it and re-do it *correctly*

## Designing the Trucks


### Description

This assignment is about making the trucks. The *base* of the trucks are **0.25inches (offset)** from the **construction line** and *extruded 0.25in*. the *truck baseplate*'s first layer is **0.5in in height**, & the 2nd layer is **0.375mm** & is **1.5 inches in length**.They are both extruded **0.75in** and are **symmetric**. The *inner truck hanger* circle is **8.5in** while the *outer circle* is **6in** + they are both *symmetric*.

### Reflection

This assignment was a Bit difficult because I didn't know if the Truck Hanger was at the right spot even after following the instructions. Even after creating it, I had to add the ledge that holds the Hanger in place. I added the ledge after completing the whole truck. *don't spend too much time on one problem, move on and get the rest 'easy' done first then come to solve the 'hard' problem.*

## Designing the Wheels and Bearing


### Description

This assignment is about making the wheels and bearings. The wheels are **revolved** around 360*. The wheel is **36mm in length** and the bearing is **0.5inches in lenght**. the wheel is **54mm in height** from the **construction line**  **( L + q)** and the bearing circle is **0.25in** from the *construction line*

### Reflection
This assignment was realy simple. Using **revolve** can make editing size, and making a circle way easier. The wheel's inside room for the bearing was also easily made because of *revolvig* the wheel. for future designs I would use revolve to make circular objects for their ease and simplness.

### Designing the Final Assembly 


### Destricption

This is the final assembly of the whole skateboard in which 8 bolts were added to the holes using **replicate**. This function was used for the nuts and bolts on the wheels and the *Truck Baseplate.* The Hanger is connected with two **Hex Machine screw nuts 3/8-24** the wheels are connected with four **Hex Machine screw nuts 5/16-24** the base plate is connected with eight **Hex Machine screws #10-32**
